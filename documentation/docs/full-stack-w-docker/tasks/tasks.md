# Tasks
This is the core functionality of the application! Once authenticated, users should be able to see the tasks of every other person on the platform by searching their username, and add and delete tasks which belong to them (this will be enforced in the [backend section](./backend.md)). 

First, you will set up the frontend for displaying tasks [here](./frontend.md). Then, you will set up the backend for retrieving and manipulating those tasks [here](./backend.md). The Postgres database is already configured so that it will update as you add models. Similarly, the `docker-compose.yaml` file won't change now that its been set up. 

Click next to set up the frontend!
