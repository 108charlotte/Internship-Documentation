# Authentication
Authenticating users will allow us to tie tasks to specific users and restrict the user to only add and delete tasks that are their own, which we will accomplish through both frontend and backend verification. 

**Logging in an existing user** requires a **frontend** where users can enter their credentials, a **database** to store existing accounts, and a **backend** to verify if the entered credentials match with any in the database. **Registering a new user** requires a **frontend** to enter the credentials of a new account, a **database** to store those credentials so the user can later log in, and a **backend** to connect the two.
